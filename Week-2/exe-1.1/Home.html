          <span class="highlight-first-word">Make</span> is a tool used to
          manage the complex projects typically used in C-Language based
          programming projects whereas
          <span class="highlight-first-word">Makefile</span> is a file used by
          the Make tool to perform the specified actions present in the
          Makefile. Make and Makefile both constitute a build system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make searches the current directory for the makefile to use, e.g. GNU Make searches files in order for a file named one of GNUmakefile, makefile, or Makefile and then runs the specified (or default) target(s) from (only) that file.
        </p>

        <p> 
          The makefile language is similar to declarative programming. This class of language, in which necessary end conditions are described but the order in which actions are to be taken is not important, is sometimes confusing to programmers used to imperative programming
        </p>

        <p>
          One problem in build automation is the tailoring of a build process to a given platform. For instance, the compiler used on one platform might not accept the same options as the one used on another. This is not well handled by Make. This problem is typically handled by generating platform-specific build instructions, which in turn are processed by Make. Common tools for this process are Autoconf, CMake or GYP (or more advanced NG).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Readmore</a>

            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
            can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
            and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
            language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is
            one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
            and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
            web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
