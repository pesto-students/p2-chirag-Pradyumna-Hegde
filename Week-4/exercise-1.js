/*
Exercise-4.1:
    Implement a function named 'getNumber' which generatesa random number. If randomNumberis divisible by 5 it will reject the promise else it will resolve the promise. Letâ€™s also keep thepromise resolution/rejection time as a variable.
    
    1.JS promises should not be used.
    2.A custom promise function should be created.
    3.This function should be able to handle all 3 states Resolve, Reject and Fulfilled.
    4.Should be able to accept callbacks as props.
